# [CS] The Metal Initiative
This is the homepage for metal sonic and his "friends"

Metals Moves:

B = Instant Spindash

Up Dpad = Charge Peelout

Up Dpad again = Release Peelout(HINT: HOLD MOVE STICK FOR FULL PEELOUT)

Y in air and doing double jump = Superform if super forms reborn is enabled

X while super = Hyper form

Mechas Moves:

same as metals for now...

Need to be added:<br/>
[x] Add a peelout move
[] Re-add charge attack (prefer to have it deal damage via metal cap)
[] In air jump if possible
